##### Priority ####

> Fix Map Scrolling (again)
	> (Possible) cause: If on edge of centerBox and moving map (eg: upwards) and press other direction (left/right), first direction (up) gets disabled
		> Otherwise key disabling happens randomly after scrolling map in a direction --- this seems to be the case

+ Collidable tile to get collisions implemented - or use water tile
+ Scenery objects (buildings, etc)
+ Item pickups
+ Inventory system
+ Multiple map environments
+ NPCs, Mobs

##### Polishing Stage #####

+ Randomizing textures of tiles - already crudely implemented with stone
+ Loading Screen (?)
+ Menus (?)

#### Ideas (Undecided) ####
+ Slight Terrain Randomization
